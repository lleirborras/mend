To execute the solution, first of all run
$ bundle install

to install necessary depencencies, like raspell.

After that just run
$ bundle exec ruby solve.rb cipher_file.txt

where cipher_file.txt is the input data file.

The result is saved at "result.txt" file and shown at the terminal.

This solution was build using raspell, a library to interact
with aspell using ruby.

Iterating all possible solutions of the keyword and checking
if it generates a corect English word I build the keyword.

Once I've got a valid keyword I try to translate the message
using it, and if more than 85% of the words in the translated message
are valid, then I consider it as a goot decryption.
