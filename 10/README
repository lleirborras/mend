To execute the solution, first of all run
$ bundle install

to install necessary depencencies, like treetop.

After that just run
$ bundle exec ruby solve.rb circuits_file.txt

where circuits_file.txt is the input data file.

The result is saved at "result.txt" file and shown at the terminal.

This solution was build on two parts, fist of all I
convert the input circuit into a binnary polish string
"A01" -> 0|1

and after that, using treetop I parse that string and
evaluate it to know even if the light is open or close.
